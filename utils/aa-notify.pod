=head1 CONFIGURATION

System-wide configuration for B<aa-notify> is done via
/etc/apparmor/notify.conf:

  # Set to 'no' to disable AppArmor notifications globally
  show_notifications="yes"

  # Special profiles used to remove privileges for unconfined binaries using user namespaces. Special profiles use Python's regular expression syntax. If unsure, leave as is.
  userns_special_profiles="unconfined,unprivileged_userns,unpriv_.*"

  # Theme for aa-notify GUI. See https://ttkthemes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/themes.html for available themes.
  interface_theme="ubuntu"

  # Binaries for which we ignore userns-related capability denials
  ignore_denied_capability="sudo,su"

  # Write change to local profiles if enabled to preserve regular profiles and simplify upgrades
  use_local_profiles

  # OPTIONAL - kind of operations which display a popup prompt.
  prompt_filter="userns"

  # OPTIONAL - restrict using aa-notify to users in the given group
  # (if not set, everybody who has permissions to read the logfile can use it)
  # use_group="admin"

  # OPTIONAL - custom notification message body
  message_body="This is a custom notification message."

  # OPTIONAL - custom notification message footer
  message_footer="For more information visit https://foo.com"

  # OPTIONAL - custom notification filtering
  # Filters are used to reduce the output of information to only those entries that will match the filter. Filters use Python's regular expression syntax.
  filter.profile="^(foo|bar)$"	# Match the profile:		Only shows notifications for profiles "foo" or "bar"
  filter.operation="^open$"	# Match the operation:		Only shows notifications for "open" operation
  filter.name="^(?!/usr/lib/)"	# Match the name:		Excludes notifications for names starting by "/usr/lib/"
  filter.denied="^r$"		# Match the denied_mask:	Only shows notifications where "r", and only "r", was denied
  filter.family="^inet$"	# Match the network family:	Only shows notifications for "inet" family
  filter.socket="stream"	# Match the network socket type: Only shows notifications for "stream" sockets

Per-user configuration is done via $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/apparmor/notify.conf (or
the deprecated ~/.apparmor/notify.conf if it exists):

  # set to 'yes' to enable AppArmor DENIED notifications
  show_notifications="yes"

=head1 BUGS

B<aa-notify> needs to be able to read the logfiles containing the
AppArmor DENIED messages.
